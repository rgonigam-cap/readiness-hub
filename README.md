## Prerequisites

- Google Workspace account
- Access to CAPWATCH data exports for your unit
- A Google Drive folder with your CAPWATCH exports (automated daily sync recommended)

## Quick Start

### 1. Copy the Project Files

Copy the Apps Script project files to a new Google Apps Script project:
1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy only the `.html` and `.gs` files from the **root** of this repository into the project

> **Important:** Do **NOT** copy the `offline/` folder, `.github/` folder, or any non-`.html`/`.gs` files. Those are build infrastructure for the [browser-based preview version](https://cap-miwg.github.io/readiness-hub/) and are not part of the Apps Script project.

### 2. Configure Required Settings

Configuration is stored securely in Script Properties (not in the code):

1. In the Apps Script editor, select `setupScriptProperties` from the function dropdown
2. Click **Run** to initialize the default property structure
3. Go to **Project Settings** (gear icon) > **Script Properties**
4. Edit these required properties:

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SOURCE_FOLDER_ID` | Google Drive folder ID with CAPWATCH exports | `1ABC...xyz` |
| `DB_SPREADSHEET_ID` | Google Sheet ID for data storage | `1DEF...abc` |
| `APP_NAME` | Full display name for your unit | `Michigan Wing Readiness Hub` |
| `APP_SHORT_NAME` | Short name for header bar and browser tab | `Readiness Hub` |

**Finding IDs:**
- **Folder ID**: Open your Drive folder, copy from URL: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{FOLDER_ID}`
- **Spreadsheet ID**: Create a new Google Sheet, copy from URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{SPREADSHEET_ID}/edit`

**Optional Configuration Properties:**

| Property | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `LOGO_DRIVE_FILE_ID` | Google Drive file ID for logo image | (no logo) |
| `DB_SHEET_NAME` | Name of the data sheet tab | `DB` |
| `LOGS_SHEET_NAME` | Name of the logs sheet tab | `Logs` |
| `GITHUB_OWNER` | GitHub username/org for feedback | - |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | Repository name for feedback | `readiness-hub` |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Personal access token (add manually) | - |
| `CAPWATCH_ORGID` | CAP organization ID for auto-download | - |

**Finding Logo File ID:**
- Upload your logo image to Google Drive
- Right-click > Share > Change to "Anyone with the link can view"
- Copy the file ID from URL: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/{FILE_ID}/view`

**Utility Functions:**
- `setupScriptProperties()` - Initialize default property values
- `showCurrentConfig()` - Display current configuration (masks sensitive values)

### 3. Run Initial Data Sync

1. In the Apps Script editor, select `syncDriveToSheet` from the function dropdown
2. Click **Run**
3. Authorize the required permissions when prompted
4. Wait for the sync to complete (check the Execution Log)

3. Configure:
   - Function: `syncDriveToSheet`
   - Event source: Time-driven
   - Type: Hour timer
   - Interval: Every hour
4. Save

## Optional: GitHub Feedback Integration

The app includes an optional feedback feature that creates GitHub issues. To enable:

1. Create a GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope
2. In Apps Script: Go to **Project Settings** (gear icon) > **Script Properties**
3. Add/edit these properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Your personal access token |
| `GITHUB_OWNER` | Your GitHub username or organization |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | Repository name (default: `readiness-hub`) |

**Optional IT Chatbot Integration:**

If you have an IT chatbot that should be notified of new issues, add these properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `CHATBOT_WEBAPP_URL` | URL to your IT chatbot web app |
| `CHATBOT_API_KEY` | API key for the chatbot |

## Optional: CAPWATCH Auto-Download

If you don't already have CAPWATCH files being placed in your `SOURCE_FOLDER_ID` folder (e.g., via [gsuite-automation](https://github.com/cap-miwg/gsuite-automation) or manual upload), the app can download CAPWATCH data directly from the CAP eServices API.

### Setup

1. In Apps Script: Go to **Project Settings** > **Script Properties**
2. Set `CAPWATCH_ORGID` to your organization ID (e.g., `223` for Michigan Wing)
3. In the Apps Script editor, select `setCapwatchAuthorization` from the function dropdown and click **Run**
4. Enter your eServices username and password when prompted
5. Test by selecting `getCapwatch` and clicking **Run** — files should appear in your `SOURCE_FOLDER_ID` folder

### Automated Daily Download + Sync

To schedule daily automatic downloads:

1. In the Apps Script editor, select `setupCapwatchTrigger` from the function dropdown
2. Click **Run** — this creates a daily trigger at 4 AM Eastern (3 AM CST)
3. The trigger downloads fresh CAPWATCH data, then syncs it to the database sheet

The trigger time avoids the CAPWATCH API daily blackout window (12:00–2:30 AM CST).

> **Note:** If you already have a separate `syncDriveToSheet` hourly trigger, you can keep both. The download+sync trigger handles the full pipeline; the hourly sync trigger provides additional refresh cycles throughout the day.

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CAPWATCH_ORGID` | Your CAP organization ID | `223` |

**Credentials** are stored per-user in UserProperties (not in Script Properties). Each admin who needs to run the download must set their own credentials via `setCapwatchAuthorization()`.

## Optional: Cadet Rank Insignia Images

The cadet dashboard displays rank insignia. By default, these use placeholder Google Drive image IDs.

To use your own images:
1. Upload rank insignia images to Google Drive
2. Make them viewable by anyone with the link
3. Update the `CADET_RANK_INSIGNIA` object in `ConfigConstants.html` with your file IDs

To disable images, set the values to empty strings.

## Troubleshooting

### "Database sheet not found" error
Run `syncDriveToSheet` manually from the Apps Script editor.

### Data not updating
- Check that CAPWATCH files are in your source folder
- Verify the sync trigger is running (check Executions in Apps Script)
- Clear the app cache by running `syncDriveToSheet` again

### Slow initial load
The first load after sync may take a few seconds to build the cache. Subsequent loads will be faster.

### Missing CAPWATCH files
The app logs warnings for missing files but continues to function. Check the Apps Script execution logs for details.
